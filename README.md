1. Select the appropriate solution for the question you're working on.

2. Copy the solution.

3. Open the answer.txt file.

4. Paste the solution and save the file (use Ctrl + S).

5. Run autotype.py:

python autotype.py
```

6. Position the cursor on the LPU Colab (iamneo) coding screen and wait for 5 seconds.


## Video Tutorial

Check out the detailed [Video Tutorial](https://github.com/flightman69/im-neo-lpu/assets/89738046/7b746212-0b1b-4676-8163-7e42fede2eff) for a visual walkthrough. 

Huge thanks to [flightman69](https://github.com/flightman69) for this insightful tutorial!

## Caution!
***autotype.py*** is running properly only on **Windows**
In **Linux** and **Mac** It has few issues.
It might type different characters for few characters.
Example: 
It may type `>>`  instead of `<<` in *linux*
It may type `3` instead of `#` in *Mac*
Just manually change these and you're good to go.

While these solutions are valuable learning aids, using them as it is for academic submissions could violate our institution's academic integrity policy. I encourage you to use these solutions to enhance your problem-solving skills and understanding of the concepts.
