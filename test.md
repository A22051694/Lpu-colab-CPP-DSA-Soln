## About

This repository is a compilation of solutions made by <strong>Me</strong> (GitHub: [ash-codes18](https://github.com/ash-codes18)) and <strong>Sushant</strong> (GitHub: [07Sushant](https://github.com/07Sushant)) for the CPP and DSA questions at Lovely Professional University (LPU) on the LPU Colab platform. The solutions provided here are intended to assist my fellow students in understanding and solving the coding problems assigned.


## Requirements

- python
- pip [<i>(See how to install pip on windows)</i>](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/)


## Installation 

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following package.

```
pip install pyautogui
```

Clone this repository to your system.

```

```

## Usage

1. Find the appropriate solution to the question.

2. Copy the answer.

3. Open answers.txt

4. Paste the answer and save the file. *(use ctrl+s )*

5. Run autotype.py
